# Feature Specification: Workspace Window Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `002-workspace-window-enhancement`
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "優化現有的程序。要求程序有能力列表電腦不同Workspace 或Desktop 上的視窗; 結果輸出要標明視窗是否Focus/minimize/Workspace; 另外，現在用戶只能搜索視窗的標題，搜索功能延伸至應用名稱(Owner)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Enhanced Window Listing with Workspace Information (Priority: P1)

Users need to see all windows across different workspaces/desktops with clear visibility indicators showing window state (focused, minimized, workspace location) to better understand their multi-desktop workflow and locate specific windows.

**Why this priority**: This is the core enhancement that extends the existing basic window listing functionality. It provides immediate value by helping users navigate complex multi-workspace environments more efficiently.

**Independent Test**: Open windows across multiple workspaces, run the enhanced list command, and verify that each window shows its current state (focused/minimized) and workspace location.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple workspaces with different windows open, **When** user runs the enhanced list command, **Then** all windows are displayed with workspace identifiers and state information
2. **Given** some windows are minimized and others focused, **When** user views the window list, **Then** each window clearly shows its current state (focused/minimized/normal)
3. **Given** user has windows on different virtual desktops, **When** listing windows, **Then** each window shows which workspace/desktop it belongs to

### User Story 2 - Extended Search Functionality (Priority: P2)

Users want to search for windows not just by title but also by application name (owner), enabling them to quickly find all windows belonging to a specific application regardless of their individual window titles.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the existing search capability by addressing a common limitation where users know the application name but not the specific window title, significantly improving search effectiveness.

**Independent Test**: Open multiple windows from the same application with different titles, search by application name, and verify all relevant windows are found.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple Chrome windows with different titles, **When** user searches for "Chrome", **Then** all Chrome windows are returned regardless of their individual titles
2. **Given** user searches for a partial application name, **When** performing case-insensitive search, **Then** all matching applications and their windows are found
3. **Given** user wants to find windows by both title and owner, **When** searching, **Then** results include matches from both title and application name

---

### User Story 3 - Cross-Workspace Window Management (Priority: P3)

Users need to identify and manage windows across different workspaces from a single view, enabling better organization and workflow management without manually switching between workspaces.

**Why this priority**: This provides advanced workflow management capabilities for power users with complex multi-workspace setups, building on the enhanced listing functionality.

**Independent Test**: Use the enhanced tools to locate and identify windows across multiple workspaces without manually switching between them.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** windows scattered across multiple workspaces, **When** user searches or lists windows, **Then** results clearly indicate which workspace each window belongs to
2. **Given** user wants to find focused window across all workspaces, **When** viewing window information, **Then** the currently focused window is clearly identified with its workspace
3. **Given** user has minimized windows on different desktops, **When** listing windows, **Then** minimized state and workspace are both clearly shown

### Edge Cases

- What happens when workspace information is unavailable or unsupported on the current platform?
- How does the system handle windows that span multiple monitors within the same workspace?
- What occurs when a window moves between workspaces while the program is running?
- How are windows handled that belong to system processes or have restricted access?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST enumerate windows across all available workspaces/virtual desktops on the current platform
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify and display the current state of each window (focused, minimized, normal)
- **FR-003**: System MUST display workspace/desktop identifier for each window in the output
- **FR-004**: System MUST extend search functionality to match against application owner names in addition to window titles
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing list and search commands
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle cases where workspace information is unavailable gracefully
- **FR-007**: Search functionality MUST support case-insensitive matching for both titles and application names
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve existing output formats (text and JSON) while adding new state information
- **FR-009**: System MUST identify the currently focused window across all workspaces
- **FR-010**: Enhanced output MUST clearly distinguish between different window states using consistent indicators

### Key Entities

- **EnhancedWindowInfo**: Extended window information including workspace ID, focus state, minimize state, and enhanced owner details
- **WorkspaceInfo**: Workspace/desktop identifier, name (if available), and current status
- **WindowState**: Enumeration of possible window states (focused, minimized, normal, hidden)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can identify window workspace location for 100% of enumerated windows
- **SC-002**: Enhanced window listing completes within the same performance targets as basic listing (<3 seconds)
- **SC-003**: Search by application name returns relevant results in under 1 second
- **SC-004**: Window state information (focus/minimize status) is accurately detected for at least 95% of windows
- **SC-005**: Enhanced functionality works correctly across all supported platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **SC-006**: Existing command-line interface remains fully functional without breaking changes
- **SC-007**: JSON output format includes all new fields while maintaining existing structure compatibility

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

- Platform workspace APIs are available and accessible for window enumeration
- Current window management permissions are sufficient to access workspace information
- Users primarily work with standard workspace/virtual desktop implementations
- Application owner information is consistently available through existing platform APIs
- Performance requirements remain the same as the existing implementation

## Dependencies

- **Existing Codebase**: Builds upon the current window manager implementation (001-window-list-filter)
- **Platform APIs**: Requires access to workspace/virtual desktop APIs on each supported platform
- **Backward Compatibility**: Must maintain compatibility with existing command-line interface and output formats

## Constraints

- Must work within existing architecture and design patterns
- Cannot break existing functionality or command-line interface
- Must support the same platforms as the current implementation
- Should maintain current performance characteristics
- Output format changes must be additive, not replacing existing fields
