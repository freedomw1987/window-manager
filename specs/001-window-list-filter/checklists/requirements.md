# Specification Quality Checklist: Window List and Filter Program

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items pass. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**Validation Details**:
- Content Quality: All sections focus on user value without technical implementation details
- Requirements: All 10 functional requirements are testable and clearly defined
- Success Criteria: All 5 criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- User Scenarios: 3 prioritized user stories with independent test criteria
- Edge Cases: 5 relevant edge cases identified for window management scenarios
