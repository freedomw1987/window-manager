# Feature Specification: Window List and Filter Program

**Feature Branch**: `001-window-list-filter`
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "編寫一個程序，去列出當前電腦所有視窗的位置，用戶可以用關鍵字去篩選出目標視窗"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Window Listing (Priority: P1)

A user wants to see all currently open windows on their computer with their basic information including position, size, and title. This provides complete visibility into what applications are running and where they are positioned on the screen.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that provides immediate value - users can quickly inventory all their open windows and understand their desktop layout.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the program and verifying it displays a complete list of all visible windows with their positions and delivers immediate value for window management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple applications are open with windows, **When** user runs the program, **Then** all visible windows are listed with their titles, positions (x, y coordinates), and dimensions (width, height)
2. **Given** no windows are open except the program itself, **When** user runs the program, **Then** the program displays an appropriate message indicating no other windows are found
3. **Given** windows are minimized or hidden, **When** user runs the program, **Then** the program lists all windows regardless of visibility state with appropriate status indicators

### User Story 2 - Keyword Filtering (Priority: P2)

A user wants to search for specific windows by entering keywords that match against window titles, allowing them to quickly find target applications among many open windows.

**Why this priority**: Filtering is essential when users have many windows open - it transforms a potentially overwhelming list into actionable results.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening multiple windows with different titles, entering various keywords, and verifying only matching windows are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple windows are open, **When** user enters a keyword that matches part of a window title, **Then** only windows containing that keyword in their title are displayed
2. **Given** a keyword is entered, **When** no windows match the search term, **Then** the program displays a message indicating no matches found
3. **Given** multiple windows contain the same keyword, **When** user searches for that keyword, **Then** all matching windows are displayed in the results

### User Story 3 - Interactive Filtering Interface (Priority: P3)

A user wants to continuously refine their search by entering different keywords without restarting the program, allowing for efficient exploration and window discovery.

**Why this priority**: Interactive search improves user experience by eliminating the need to restart the program for each search, making the tool more practical for repeated use.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the program, entering multiple different search terms sequentially, and verifying the results update appropriately for each search.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the program is running and displaying results, **When** user enters a new keyword, **Then** the display updates to show only windows matching the new keyword
2. **Given** a filtered view is displayed, **When** user clears the search or enters an empty keyword, **Then** all windows are displayed again
3. **Given** the program is running, **When** user enters consecutive searches with different keywords, **Then** each search produces accurate results without requiring program restart

### Edge Cases

- What happens when windows are rapidly opening/closing during program execution?
- How does the system handle windows with very long titles or special characters?
- What occurs when the program lacks permissions to access certain window information?
- How does the program behave when windows are on multiple monitors?
- What happens when window titles contain the same text as the search keyword but in different cases?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST enumerate all currently open windows on the user's computer
- **FR-002**: System MUST capture window position information including X and Y coordinates relative to the primary display
- **FR-003**: System MUST capture window size information including width and height in pixels
- **FR-004**: System MUST retrieve window title text for identification purposes
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide keyword-based filtering functionality that matches against window titles
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to enter search keywords to filter the window list
- **FR-007**: System MUST perform case-insensitive keyword matching for user convenience
- **FR-008**: System MUST display search results in a clear, readable format showing window title, position, and size
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle scenarios where no windows match the search criteria gracefully
- **FR-010**: System MUST support partial keyword matching (substring search) within window titles

### Key Entities

- **Window**: Represents an open application window with attributes including title (text), position coordinates (x, y), size dimensions (width, height), and visibility state
- **Search Query**: Represents the user's keyword input for filtering windows, containing the search term and matching criteria

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view complete window inventory in under 3 seconds from program launch
- **SC-002**: Keyword searches return filtered results in under 1 second regardless of the number of open windows
- **SC-003**: System accurately detects and lists 100% of user-accessible windows that are currently open
- **SC-004**: Users can successfully locate target windows using keyword search in 90% of attempts when the target window exists
- **SC-005**: Program functions correctly with up to 50 simultaneous open windows without performance degradation
