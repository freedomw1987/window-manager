# This file ensures the build directory is tracked by Git
#
# The build directory is needed for CMake builds, but we ignore all build artifacts
# except this file to keep the repository clean while maintaining the directory structure.
#
# Build instructions:
# 1. mkdir -p build && cd build
# 2. cmake ..
# 3. make
